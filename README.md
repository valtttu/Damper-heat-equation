# Damper-heat-equation

This Jupyter notebook contains the code and text for *PHYS-E0412 Computational Physics* course project. The project is about modelling the heating of a damper in a very simplified geometry and scenario. The data for the damper movement is gathered using the DIY suspension wizard MTB data logger (more info [here](https://wiki.aalto.fi/display/MEX/DIY+suspension+wizard+-+mountain+bike+suspension+data+logger)).
